## Peripheral Device
- Devices connected to processor externally are known as Peripherals.
- Apart from main memory all other devices are Peripherals.

### Type of Devices Under Peripherals
1. Input devices
2. Output devices
3. Storage devices

### Can CPU Access IO Directly?
- No, CPU needs interface to connect with any type of peripherals.
- Interface can be software as well as hardware, device-drivers provides the interface.
- Functionalties provided by an interface
  1. Conversion of signals.
  2. Synchronization (Read/Write speed match).
  3. Conversion of data formats.
  4. Controls other peripherals to not disturb the operation of other peripherals.

### IO VS Memory Buses
- Each IO device have their own address in a system.
- There can various configuration for bus for I/O and Memory
  1. Separate - Address, Data and Control for I/O and Memory.
  2. Common - Address and Data bus, but same control bus.
  2. Commom - Address, Data and Control bus.

### Separate Buses for Both (I/O and Memory)
  ![](/Images/separate_bus_for_io_memory.jpg)
  - Implementation is costly.
  - Not used widely

### Common Data and Address Bus
  ![](/Images/common_add_data_bus_for_io_memory.jpg)
  - Address generated by CPU will be accessible to both I/O and Memory, but control signal of individual entity will decide where to perform operation.
  - This type of design also knows as **I/O Mapped I/O** or **Port Mapped I/O**.

### Common Address, Data and Control Bus
  ![](/Images/common_add_data_and_control_bus_for_io_memory.jpg)
  - I/O and Memory will have well defined addresses.
  - Address will be taken from memory.
  - Lets say system have 8 Byte - byte addressable memory and 2 I/O devices, then Memory will have 6 address and 2 will be assigned to I/O.
  - Clearly, Memory is being under-utilized.
  - This configuration also known as **Memory Mapped I/O**.

    |**Memory Mapped I/O**|**I/O Mapped I/O**|
    |:-|:-|
    |I/O devices don't have their own address space.|I/O devices have their own address space.|
    |Memory wastage.|No Memory wastage.|
    |Same Control Word set for Memory and I/O.|Separate Set of Control word for Memory and I/O respectively.|
    |More instruction for I/O Access.|Less instruction for I/O|
    |More Addressing modes for I/O.|Less Addressing Mode for I/O.|
    |More number I/O devices can be connected.|Less I/O devices.|
  

## Asychronous Data Transfer (Serial)
- Data transfer between components of a computer system i.e between CPU and I/O, or between Memory and I/O, etc.
- Synchronous data transfer is not implemented in computer system as read-write speed of computer components varies drastically, since clock rate needs to be set as per the component having lowest read-write speed, synchronous data transfer can degrade the performance.
- In Asynchronous data transfer component work with dfferent clocks.
- Computer components will having external-synchronization.
- Whether computer supports synchrnous or asynchronous data transfer is mentioned in computer's architecture.

## Serial VS Parallel data transfer.
|Serial|Parallel|
|:-|:-|
|There will one line b/w components.|N-number of lines b/w components.|
|1-bit at a time|n-bits at a time|
|Cost Effective|Costly|
