## Peripheral Device
- Devices connected to processor externally are known as Peripherals.
- Apart from main memory all other devices are Peripherals.

### Type of Devices Under Peripherals
1. Input devices
2. Output devices
3. Storage devices

### Can CPU Access IO Directly?
- No, CPU needs interface to connect with any type of peripherals.
- Interface can be software as well as hardware, device-drivers provides the interface.
- Functionalties provided by an interface
  1. Conversion of signals
  2. Synchronisation
  3. Conversion of data formats
  4. Controls other peripherals to not disturb the operation of other peripherals.

### IO VS Memory Buses
- Each IO device have their own address in a system.
