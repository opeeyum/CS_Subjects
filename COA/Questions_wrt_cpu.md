1. Question: [GATE 2014]

   Consider two processors P1 and P2 executing the same instruction set. Assume that under identical conditions, for the same input, a program running on P2 takes 25% less time but incurs 20% more CPI (clock cycles per instruction) as compared to program running on P1. If the clock frequency of P1 is 1GHz, then the clock frequency ofP2 (in GHz) is _____ ?

   Answer

    1.6 Ghz

   Solution
   |Parameters|P1|P2|
   |----|----|----|
   |no. of instructions|n|n|
   |execution time|t1|t2 = 0.75t1|
   |CPI|C1|C2 = 1.2C1|
   |Frequency (clock rate)| f1 = 1Ghz| f2 = ?|

   We know that, execution time for n instruction = n * CPI<sub>Avg</sub> * cycle time

   => cycle time = $1 \over clock-rate$

   => t1 = $n . C1 \over f1$

   => t2 = $n . C2 \over f2$ = $n*1.2*C1 \over f2$

   => since t2 = .75 x t1

   => $n*1.2*C1 \over f2$ = .75 x $n . C1 \over f1$

   On putting values will get, 1.6 Ghz
